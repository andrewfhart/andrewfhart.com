          h3 About Me:
          :markdown
            I am a __software engineer__. I use computer science to solve problems. 
            I have applied my skills to a variety of situations, and am
            currently part of a team developing data management software to support large-scale, 
            data-driven research at [NASA](http://jpl.nasa.gov).   
            
            I consider myself primarily a front-end developer, however I often find 
            myself straddled
            between front and back-end components in working
            to better expose the capabilities of a system to end-users via the Web. I
            strive to design interfaces and services that enable intuitive, streamlined 
            access to large quantities of data.

            When I'm not developing software, I can usually be found out and about taking 
            photos. Photography is a long-time passion of mine, and you'll more often than 
            not catch me with a camera. I particularly enjoy exploring, investigating, or just searching 
            around for an interesting shot.

        :markdown
          ![NASA Logo](/images/logos/nasa.jpeg)
          I am currently a software engineer at the NASA [Jet Propulsion 
          Laboratory (JPL)](http://jpl.nasa.gov) in Pasadena, California. I'm a member of the Data Management
          Systems and Technologies group, and part of a team developing customized data management 
          software to support ongoing scientific research across a broad spectrum of domains.

          ![Apache Software Foundation Logo](/images/logos/apache.jpeg)
          I am a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org), where I contribute to a number
          of [awesome open source projects](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#ahart) including 
          [Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT)](http://oodt.apache.org), a component-based
          information integration framework for building distributed, data-intensive software systems.

          ![IEEE Logo](/images/logos/ieee.jpeg)
          I am a member of both IEEE and the IEEE Computer Society, and I have had 
          [papers accepted](/publications) at a number of IEEE-sponsored conferences, including 
          CBMS 2009, HEALTHINF 2009, and ICSE 2011 SECLOUD.

          ![University of Southern California Logo](/images/logos/viterbi.jpeg)
          I received a M.S. in Computer Science, with an emphasis in Software 
          Engineering, from the [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](http://viterbi.usc.edu) in May, 2007. I graduated with a
          B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Multimedia and Creative Technologies from the USC 
          Viterbi school in May, 2005.

          ![Information Sciences Institute Logo](/images/logos/isi.jpeg)
          I held a Research Assistantship position at the [USC Information Sciences 
          Institute](http://isi.edu) from 2006-2007. Working under Dr. Ted Faber, I designed a 
          system for mutual assurance, at the BIOS level, between a networked cluster node and a 
          controlling server.

          ![Southern California Earthquake Center Logo](/images/logos/scec.jpeg)
          In 2004-2005, I participated in the [Southern California Earthquake Center](http://scec.edu)'s 
          Undergraduate Studies in Earthquake Information Technology (UseIT) program and, 
          working with a team of 15 undergraduates, built the first version of SCEC-VDO, 
          an open source visualization product that enables interactive, 4D display of 
          diverse geo-referenced datasets for analysis, presentation, and publication.

          ![Southern California Earthquake Center Logo](/images/logos/impac.gif)
          In 2003, I held a summer internship at IMPAC Medical Systems (now part of Elekta) 
          developing internal tools for intelligently replacing protected health information 
          with reasonable alternatives to facilitate QA and testing.
