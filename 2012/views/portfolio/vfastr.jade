        h4 Project Overview:
        :markdown
          The V-FASTR project is an attempt to positively identify and classify what are known as
          _fast radio transient events_. These short-lived bursts of radio energy are emitted both by
          mundane sources here on Earth (say, a garage door opener pulsing) and exotic sources out in the 
          universe (say, the annihilation of a black hole). Properly classifying these potentially 
          fascinating events is important to better
          understanding their true nature. V-FASTR collects its data passively by piggybacking on
          top of ongoing experiments utilizing the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) instrument. The
          collected data is far too massive to keep in whole for very long, and thus reviews of candidate
          events need to be
          conducted daily to avoid a backlog exceeding storage capacity.

        h4 How I Contributed:
        :markdown
          The V-FASTR science team _wanted a way to collaboratively review events that had been flagged
          as interesting by the automated filters_. Reviewers needed to see imagery for each candidate event 
          alongside salient metadata annotations. After working with the science team, _I constructed a metadata
          model that described the domain_, and _developed a web application that allowed for a shared view of recent events_, as well as
          _provided customized views of an individual reviewer's assigned workload_. I went through several iterations
          with members of the science team to streamline the review process (e.g.: minimizing mouse clicks,
          and prioritizing certain metadata fields).
