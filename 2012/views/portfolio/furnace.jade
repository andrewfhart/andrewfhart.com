        h4 Project Overview:
        :markdown
          Furnace began in 2006 out of _a desire to better understand the "magic" going on inside newly popular PHP
          frameworks like Symfony and CakePHP_. URL Routing, Front Controllers, Object Relational Mapping, all of it was
          fascinating to me. In the process of developing web applications up to that point I had amassed a small
          toolkit of useful homegrown scripts for doing common tasks like implementing user authentication, form
          generation, and so on. These formed the basis for what would eventually become Furnace.
          
          For several years, _Furnace was my playground; my sandbox for exploring PHP and trying out new ideas_ for
          "making things better". More than once I rebuilt it from the ground up, and _I learned to appreciate the
          importance of thinking things through_, of flushing out potentially limiting assumptions before they become hopelessly ingrained in
          layers of code. 
          
          _After a few years, many lessons, and over a thousand subversion revisions later_, I had a framework that I was
          actively
          using in a number of personal projects and even some applications for consulting clients. That it did its
          job was never a concern: it wasn't fancy, but neither was I engaging it in anything too exotic. _The concern
          was that I was the only person on Earth who knew how it worked_. I found myself never being able to turn over
          a project and move on, because no one else could readily maintain it. This reality, combined with the fact that,
          _suddenly, the traditional LAMP stack wasn't the only choice for web applications anymore_, was the beginning of
          the end for my relationship with Furnace.
          
          I _occasionally use Furnace as an excuse to try new things_. I recently moved the Furnace codebase to
          GitHub, partly as an attempt to get greater visibility for it, but mostly for the chance to dig into git and
          the absolutely addictive magic that is GitHub. _Furnace helped me grow as a software engineer_. It was a project
          I poured my soul into, and thus had an incentive to maintain over time. _It taught me about organizing code, 
          the challenges of refactoring a large codebase, introduced me to continuous integration and unit tests, allowed
          me to explore the promise and the
          limitations of object-relational-mapping, balance optimizations and performance, and probably a hundred other
          things besides_.
          
          Though I have moved on from Furnace, it still has a warm place in my heart, and I do poke around in the code 
          from time to time, as much to reminisce as to patch something up for the one or two applications still running
          on it in the wild.

        h4 How I Contributed:
        :markdown
          I am the architect and primary developer of Furnace. Lest that come across as boastful, I am also its primary, if not only user. Developing Furnace has taught me volumes about software engineering, as I describe above.
