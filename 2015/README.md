# [Andrewfhart.com](http://andrewfhart.com) Source Code

This is the source code of Andrewfhart.com, a personal portfolio website built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a fantastic open-source Jekyll template called [mademistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/).

`images/` has been split into its [own repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-images) to reduce the size of this repo.

### Development

1. Install dependencies `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
2. Run Jekyll server to preview `(bundle exec) jekyll serve --config _config.yml (--no-watch)`.
