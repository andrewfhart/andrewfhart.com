        h4 Project Overview:
        :markdown
          The Early Detection Research Network is an effort funded by the U.S.
          National Cancer Institute tasked with the identification and validation
          of biomarkers (biological indicators) for early detection of cancer. The
          research is conducted by a collection of roughly fourty cooperating
          institutions geographically distributed across the U.S., each taking 
          pursuing independent but complementary studies. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory
          has acted as the Informatics Center for the network since 2001, and has
          been charged with supporting the diverse data-sharing needs of the distributed 
          research network.

        h4 How I Contributed:
        :markdown
          My first role on the project was to _develop a relational database schema and 
          corresponding web application_
          to facilitate data collection by EDRN curation experts. The user interface
          had to accommodate the EDRN's hierarchical data model and allow curators to enter
          data at the correct "level." Time saving features such as _automatically pulling 
          in relevant data from the NIH's PubMed medical publication database_ and
          convenience features like _AJAX-based auto-completion_ contributed to rapid 
          adoption and a reduction in annotation errors.
